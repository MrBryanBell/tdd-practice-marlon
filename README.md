This is a basic javacript project which allow us to test different kind of functions using vite project and vitest. In this project we will see how to test a sum function, an array function and a palindrome function.
 - sum : allow us to summarize two numbers.
 - arrayMean: allow us to calculate the mean value from an array.
 - isPalindrome: checks for a given string and evaluates if it is a palindrome.
